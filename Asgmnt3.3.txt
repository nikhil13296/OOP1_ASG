What would happen when the following is compiled and executed.
class example {
 int x; int y;
 String name;
 public static void main(String args[]) {
 example pnt = new example();
 System.out.println ("pnt is " + pnt.name + " " + pnt.x + " " + pnt.y);
} }


Ans:
d. The program prints pnt is null 0 0.
As java automatically initialize int to 0 and Srting datatype to Null and boolean to false.
